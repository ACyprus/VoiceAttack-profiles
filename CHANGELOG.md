## EliteDangerous v… don’t even ask

Added EliteDangerous profile in its current state. It’s in no way sanitised or 
advised for general use, but feel free to dig around and draw inspiration from 
it. Soon™ it will be published in a more usable state, but I wanted to get it 
out there for reference.

## SpanshAttack v1.0

* initial release
* expect bugs
