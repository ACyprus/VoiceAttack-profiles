# EliteDangerous #

This is my personal VoiceAttack profile for Elite: Dangerous. It started out 
ages ago as a modification of [MalicVR’s public 
profile](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/malics-voice-attack-profile-for-vr.351050/), 
then looked less and less and less like that and I added and cleaned up a lot of 
things while removing the stuff I didn’t use anyway. By now it would have 
probably been simpler starting from scratch.

Some of it has grown to a state that it might be useful to others in its own 
package, so I’ve separated the neutron jumping and Seals stuff into their own 
profiles.

The rest is a random conglomerate of all things VA and E:D; from various voice 
commands and some buttons that are now being handled by VA to lots of EDDI event 
handlers.

Speaking of EDDI; it has become in integral part of my Elite experience, 
especially the plethora of information it extracts from the game’s journal and 
presents to you via lots and lots of status variables and by firing various 
events that can then be handled through VA commands. It’s great. Check it out.  
(You might want to make it talk a lot less in it’s personality options, or 
disable the speech responder entirely like I have.)

This profile doesn’t have and probably never will have an exhaustive 
documentation (or basically any documentation at all). That said, the commands 
themselves have some comments that might be useful in understanding what they 
do. If one does(’t, bug me until it does.

Go through the thing, look at what is possible with some fiddling, then do your 
own crazy shit :D
