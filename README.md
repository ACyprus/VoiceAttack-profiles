# Elite Dangerous VoiceAttack Profiles #

These are various profiles for [VoiceAttack](https://voiceattack.com) (VA) I use 
to enhance my Elite experience. They give me important info, facilitate 
day-to-day gaming and do some special things for [Fuel 
Rats](https://fuelrats.com) and [Hull Seals](https://hullseals.space) work.

**NOTE**: Further development is on hold and Odyssey compatibility will not be
worked on for the time being. See [the corresponding issue on
Github](https://github.com/alterNERDtive/VoiceAttack-profiles/issues/113). This
might or might not change after the Horizons/Odyssey merge when console release
is upon us. Feel free to file issues for anything that is broken on Odyssey and
it will be worked on when it is worked on.

## Available Profiles ##

* EliteAttack: The main Elite VA profile. Anything related to “just” playing the
  game.
* RatAttack: Manages interactions with the FuelRats IRC server.
* SpanshAttack: Plots and follows trips along the neutron highway using
  [Spansh’s neutron plotter](https://spansh.co.uk/plotter).
* StreamAttack: Writes various status things to files that can then be read by
  streaming software like OBS.
