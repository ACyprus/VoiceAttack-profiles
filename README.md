# Elite Dangerous VoiceAttack Profiles #

These are various profiles for [VoiceAttack](https://voiceattack.com) (VA) I use 
to enhance my Elite experience. They give me important info, facilitate 
day-to-day gaming and do some special things for [Fuel 
Rats](https://fuelrats.com) and [Hull Seals](https://hullseals.space) work.

## Available Profiles ##

* EliteAttack: The main Elite VA profile. Anything related to “just” playing the
  game.
* RatAttack: Manages interactions with the FuelRats IRC server.
* SpanshAttack: Plots and follows trips along the neutron highway using
  [Spansh’s neutron plotter](https://spansh.co.uk/plotter).
* StreamAttack: Writes various status things to files that can then be read by
  streaming software like OBS.
